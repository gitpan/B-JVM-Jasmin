B::JVM - crude JVM backend for the Perl compiler.

  This module is a crude JVM backend for the Perl compiler. It aspires to be a
  "proof of concept," but I think it does not even achieve that.  It's close,
  though, and I think it might encourage people to explore this a little
  further.

Installation:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install # (if you really want to)

  Currently, this module compiles some very simple programs, such as the
  example.pl included with this distributions. It's very unlikely that it will
  compile a more complex program. 

Usage:

    perl -MO=JVM,CLASSNAME perl_program.pl
    jasmin CLASSNAME.asm
    java CLASSNAME

  Where perl_program.pl is a perl program and CLASSNAME is the name of the
  class you want to generate.

Requirements:

  Probably a fresh development version of Perl.  I've tested this only
  with 5.005_60

  The Jasmin Java Assembler.  It comes with _Java_Virtual_Machine_, 
  by John Meyer and Troy Downing (O'Reilly and Associates) and can be
  found online at http://mrl.nyu.edu/meyer/jvm/jasmin.html
